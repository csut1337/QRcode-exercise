## Overview

I am relatively new to WebDev and have begun taking some Udemy classes to try to learn. I was nervous to start this project because I knew it was still a bit of a reach for my current knowledge, but all the advice I have been getting is that it is never too early to dive in so I gave it a go. It took much longer than I hoped (couple hours of troubleshooting once I had the layout mostly done) but I think I figured out the 'whys' of each problem I ran into without going to any of the help channels! Thanks for checking it out and any potential feedback would be much appreciated!

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Using the Inspect tools within a browser is a very effective way to troubleshoot specificity conflicts and style inheritence.
- Grouping parents and children in the same class can be prohibitive for getting the children to style specifically on their own.
- This is the first time I have had to submit/modify anything on GitHub so the upload guides were very helpful.

### Continued development

I am nearing completion of the CSS portion of the webdev classes I am working on and am finding that I still need a lot of HTML/CSS practice. Frontendmentor seems to be the best resource around for projects and development within HTML/CSS so I plan to focus a bit more on those before moving on! Flexbox and CSS specificity conflicts were the biggest issues I ran into on this project so that seems like a good jumping-off point.

### Useful resources

- https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/ - This is the Udemy course I am currently working through. At the time of submission, I am just reaching the Responsive Design and Media Queries section.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phWxA89Dy94 - 8minute FlexBox runthrough. I am new enough to CSS that this really helped me to troubleshoot and rule out Flexbox issues.
